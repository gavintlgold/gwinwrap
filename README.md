Choose, set, and run--it's that simple.

A simpler alternative to xwinwrap's confusing commands, this unofficial chooser panel currently supports both xscreensavers and videos (through mplayer). It offers a few options (opacity and whether to use nice) and starts xwinwrap with a screensaver or video of choice (+ optional arguments). If the chosen screensaver allows the "--speed" option, it will detect that and enable the slider (this is not always reliable).

A few example presets are included, but it's easy to create your own new effects and save them to use again.

For now, execute it in the directory. It requires xscreensaver and xwinwrap, and mplayer for video support.

TODO (in order of priority)
===

- Add a button to show the manpage of the effect the user wishes to use (for easier options reference)
- Add an Import/Export option so that users can share their own custom presets with others.
- Detect screensaver arguments and add widgets accordingly, along with a brief description and the name, rather than filename, of the saver (this would be quite a task).
- Code is written by newbie coder (me), perhaps it needs cleanup.
